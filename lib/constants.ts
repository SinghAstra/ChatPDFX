export const data = `An Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as an intermediary between the user and computer hardware. It allows you to interact with the machine, run applications, and manage resources.

💡 Hint: Think of the OS as the manager of a hotel. It assigns rooms (memory), serves food (I/O), and takes care of requests (processes).

🧠 Functions of an Operating System
Process Management
Handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.

Hint: A process is a program in execution (e.g., when you open Chrome).

Memory Management
Allocates and deallocates memory space to programs in use.

File System Management
Organizes and stores data in files and directories.

Device Management
Manages input/output devices like keyboards, printers, and hard disks.

Security & Access Control
Protects data from unauthorized access and ensures system security.

User Interface (UI)
Offers CLI (Command Line Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface) for user interaction.

🧩 Types of Operating Systems
Batch OS
Executes jobs in batches with minimal user interaction.

Time-Sharing OS
Multiple users access the system simultaneously (via time slices).

Distributed OS
Manages multiple computers as if they are one (used in networks).

Embedded OS
Lightweight OS used in devices like ATMs, routers, and smartwatches.

Real-Time OS (RTOS)
Responds to input instantly, used in critical systems like flight control.

Mobile OS
OS designed for smartphones and tablets (e.g., Android, iOS).

💡 Hint: Think of Time-Sharing OS as a school timetable — each subject (process) gets a turn.

⚙️ Examples of Operating Systems
Windows – Popular for desktops and laptops.

macOS – Apple's OS for Mac systems.

Linux – Open-source, widely used in servers.

Android – Based on Linux, used in smartphones.

iOS – Apple's mobile OS.

Hint: Linux is great for developers. Try Ubuntu if you're new.

🔁 Process States in OS
Processes move through different states:

New – Just created

Ready – Waiting to be assigned to CPU

Running – Currently being executed

Waiting – Waiting for I/O

Terminated – Finished execution

💡 Hint: A process is like a task in a queue. Only one can use the CPU at a time (in single-core).

🧮 Memory Management Techniques
Paging – Divides memory into fixed blocks (pages).

Segmentation – Divides memory into segments (code, data, stack).

Virtual Memory – Uses part of disk space as extra RAM.

Hint: Virtual memory is like borrowing space from hard disk when RAM is full.

🛠️ Scheduling Algorithms
Used to decide which process runs next:

FCFS (First Come First Serve)

SJF (Shortest Job First)

Round Robin

Priority Scheduling

Hint: Round Robin is like giving each person a few minutes to talk in a group.

🔐 Security in OS
Authentication – Verifies user identity (e.g., password).

Authorization – Grants access rights.

Encryption – Protects data from attackers.

Hint: OS security is like a bank’s security – login, permissions, encryption.

📚 Why is OS Important for Developers?
Helps understand how apps interact with hardware.

Essential for building efficient software.

Useful in competitive programming and system design.

Hint: If you're learning web or Android development, knowing OS basics helps debug performance issues.
